# Contains-Duplicate

# Code Description

This repository contains an implementation of the 'Solution' class that provides a method called 'containsDuplicate'. The purpose of this method is to determine whether a list of numbers contains duplicate elements.

The 'containsDuplicate' method employs a set-based approach to check for the presence of duplicate elements in the provided list. It iterates through the elements of the list and inserts them into a set ('hset'). If an element is already present in the set, the method returns 'True', indicating that there are duplicate elements in the list. Otherwise, the element is added to the set. If the iteration completes without finding duplicates, the method returns 'False'.
